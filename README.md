# Thread MQTT-SN Client Library
**Sources were merged directly into [openthread fork](https://github.com/kyberpunk/openthread/blob/master/README.md) for better integration.**

This repository contains MQTT-SN client implementation based on OpenThread SDK. Protocol communicates over UDP in Thread mesh network. For further knowledge about MQTT-SN protocol and gateway concept you should read [the MQTT-SN specification](http://mqtt.org/new/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/MQTT-SN_spec_v1.2.pdf).

For development purposes and better interoperability the repository contains terporarily whole project created by [MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE).

The project is in very early stage of development, it may change over time. Documentation will be released in January 2019. Library will be integrated into OT CLI example in the future.

## Library Description

## Examples

## Sample Application Build

## Demonstration
There are prepared public [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images which can be used for MQTT-SN communication demonstration. Images are built for ARM architecture and tested on [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) platform.

### Prerequisities
You should have installed Docker CE environment. Please follow [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for product installation and configuration.

Create new network ``test`` with IP address ``172.18.0.0`` so specific IP addresses can be set to individual images.
```
sudo docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 test
```

### Obtain and run demonstration images
#### kyberpunk/border-router
Image contains custom build of [OpenThread Border Router](https://github.com/openthread/borderrouter). OpenThread official image can be used instead. Image must run on computer with connected Thread NCP device. You can find documentation and more information on [project website](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/docker/run).

```
# Download OTBR image
sudo docker pull kyberpunk/border-router

# Run OTBR container
sudo docker run -d --name border-router --sysctl "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 \
        net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1" \
        -p 80:80 --dns=127.0.0.1 -it --volume \
        /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 --net test --ip 172.18.0.6 \
        --privileged kyberpunk/border-router \
        --ncp-path /dev/ttyACM0 --nat64-prefix "2018:ff9b::/96"
```
NAT64 network prefix is set to ``2018:ff9b::/96`` because default prefix cannot be applied on devices in private network. Container is started in network ``test`` with IP address ``172.18.0.6``. You should set ``--ncp-path`` parameter accordingly to your host platform.

#### kyberpunk/mosquitto
Image contains custom build of [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker. For demonstration purposes is broker configured to use no authentication and no security. Broker is listening on standard port 1883 which is also bound to host machine network interfaces. Container IP address in Docker network is set to ``172.18.0.7``. Any MQTT client can be used for testing MQTT-SN demonstration.

```
# Download Mosquitto image
sudo docker pull kyberpunk/mosquitto

# Run container
sudo docker run -d --name mosquitto --net test --ip 172.18.0.7 --privileged \
        -p 1883:1883 kyberpunk.azurecr.io/mosquitto
```

#### kyberpunk/paho
Image contains build of [Eclipse Paho MQTT-SN gateway](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c) which provides connection from MQTT-SN protocol to MQTT broker. Gateway implements MQTT-SN over UDP in IPv4 networks.

```
# Download MQTT-SN Paho gateway image
sudo docker pull kyberpunk/paho

# Run container
sudo docker run -d --name paho --privileged --net test --ip 172.18.0.8 \
        -p 10000:10000 -p 10000:10000/udp kyberpunk.azurecr.io/paho \
        --broker-name 172.18.0.7 --broker-port 1883
```

Gateway is listening on port ``10000`` and can be reached from Thread network with IPv6 address ``2018:ff9b::ac12:8``. Listening port is also bound to host machine. Multicast cannot be used without more complex network configuration because the gateway is outside of Thread network. Gateway is connected to Mosquitto image described above. You can change broker instance with ``--broker-name`` and ``--broker-port`` parameters.

#### kyberpunk/paho6
Image contains build of [Eclipse Paho MQTT-SN gateway](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt-sn.embedded-c) which provides connection from MQTT-SN protocol to MQTT broker. This image uses UDP over IPv6 implementation. This sample is used for IPv6 multicast communication inside of Thread network so MQTT-SN multicast features can be tested.

```
# Download MQTT-SN Paho gateway image
sudo docker pull kyberpunk/paho

# Run container
sudo docker run -d --name paho6 --privileged --net container:border-router \
        kyberpunk.azurecr.io/paho --broker-name 172.18.0.7 --broker-port 1883
```
Container uses the same network devices as Border Router container. Gateway is listening on port ``10000`` on ``wpan0`` interface. Gateway can be discovered with MQTT-SN gateway discovery on well-known multicast address ``ff02::2``. Gateway cannot be reached on another interfaces.
